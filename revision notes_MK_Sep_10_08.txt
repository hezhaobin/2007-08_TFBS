Oct 2nd revision 2
Things to do:
1. the calculation Marty comes up with
2. refocus the discussion part
3. use Pollard's PWM to predict
4. expected prob of inc-dec
5. expected number of with-in site prediction
6. finish the references
7. overhaul the whole document.  get this done by Sunday.

adv: 
discussion, quality, use Pollard's matrices.  
choice of cutoff: in consideration of the noise, investigate the impact of choosing the impact

Discussion
*1. explain how I estimate the effects
*2. choice of the cutoff--rationale and the impact of the choice of the cutoff
3. information content figure, give legend
4. re-read the whole thing and correct the expressions and wordings
5. Compensation--what's the rate of turnover, is it normal or what, is the compensation complete?
we did find sim-specific sites and observe the oposite pattern in them.  flanking sites.
try to combine the information of how many sites are subject to turnover into the asymmetry table
6. possibility of co-evolution
7. matrix biases.
Discussion 
1. how much the asymmetry depend on the quality of the PWM
use another set of PWM
4. SELEX matrices verification
5. the meaning of having 30 factors in the dataset.
